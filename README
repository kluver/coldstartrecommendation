This repository includes all code needed to reproduce the evaluations from "Evaluating Recommender Behavior For New Users".

This code has only been tested on a branch lenskit available at https://github.com/kluver/lenskit

To run this code install the branch of lenskit, and then change to the lenskti directory and run `mvn lenskit-eval`
This will take some time, and may require increasing the RAM limit for your JAVA heap.

We will test this code with the newset release of lenskit before Recsys 2014 and update this documentation.

Please email kluver@cs.umn.edu if you have any questions about this code.
